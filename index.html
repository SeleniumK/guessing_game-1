     <h2>Willie's bio and preferences</h2>
     <h3>Seattle is the bomb, right?</h3>
     <p>"We are also the home of Bruce Lee, James Earl Hendrix, and so many others!"
     </p>
     <p>My project concerns the stereotypes and weird tall-tales of the Pacific NorthWest</p>
     <p>My script is asking three questions using the prompt command that pops up a box. I created functions using "var = " and used these functions to create conditions for either "YES" or "NO" answers.  I also used ".toUpperCase " and the logical operator " || " for error correction. Finally, I used if/else statements to return statements depending on the answer the user chooses. I also used console.log for debugging purposes.
     </p>
     <p> My background is in the humanities and thus I am a little nervous about starting up this class. However, I am very good at acquiring foreign languages, so perhaps that will help. My eventual goal is to find a career as a programmer.
